# notes: 
- skill, without the context of a problem to solve or a message to communicate, means nothing. 
- discussed differences between original thought and original idea, which weren't clear to me — so i emailed sharon & patrick asking for them. 
- discussed pointers for agreeing upon a *way of working* in groups, through activities that i didn't think brought out the best answers. 
- took turns reading [red's slides](https://new.express.adobe.com/publishedV2/urn:aaid:sc:US:c0d15545-d3fa-4684-bcda-61ceea576064?category=search), and it anchored us to the weight of the program. that was powerful. i read the following line: 

>   the machine itself makes no demands and holds out no promises. it is the human spirit that makes demands and keeps promises. 
>   
>   by *lewis mumford*. 

it felt like red spoke to me, posthumously. or perhaps i have an inflated sense of self. 

either way, i still consider it a moment of magic.

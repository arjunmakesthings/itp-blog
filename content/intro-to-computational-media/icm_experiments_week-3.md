i had to make a sketch with [[may]] for this. the ask by [[people/mimi yin|mimi yin]] was: 

> use conditional statements to control the flow of your programs. Create a sketch that asks people to make difficult choices that have surprising consequences.

---
may wanted to do something about choosing college versus staying in corporate america. we brainstormed for a few minutes together, and then i programmed a scaffold for her to mess around with: 

![[z_images/vid 2.mov]]

code: 

``` js
//relationships; with maythana (may); 22 september, 2025.

/*
the ask is make a program that uses conditional statements, and asks people to make difficult choices that have surprising consequences. 

may had an idea of showing how it's a difficult choice to go to college (because you lose money), versus stay in the job that you're in (make the same, and, eventually, more money). but the consequences are surprising — you're initially more happy in college (you get to do the thing you want to do), and then make more money once you graduate (because you're more 'skilled'). 
*/

/*
this is now quick writing by arjun to define the structure of the program. 

there is a canvas. a person has 3 choices: 
- stay where you are, and stagnate (center). 
- go to college (left), stay with your job (right). 
    -   go to college (left) means you: 
        - lose money
        - increase happiness 
        - after a certain amount of time, make more money. 
    - stay in job (right) means that you: 
        - let the money you have remain
        - lose happiness
        - eventually get a little more money.

i know i could've programmed this more efficiently, and designed it the way *i* wanted to. but i'm trying to be better at working with teams, and may said something that i wanted to help break: 

> (while talking about an idea) 
> 
> m: i don't think this is possible ... 
> a: everything is possible.

i think a lot of people at itp (even [[people/william|william]] & [[people/summer|summer]] are guilty of this) think something is *not* possible. everything is possible, we just don't know how to do it yet; which is why we're on the floor — if something cannot be made here (where we're surrounded by gods), it cannot be made anywhere else. 

if you have an idea, you must have the confidence in yourself to learn whatever you need to. we now have access to the people who can help us learn; we just need to take the leap in ourselves. 

may didn't think this was possible. i've programmed sketches with vaguely-similar concepts for so long that i knew it was. it took me perhaps a couple of hours to put it together (while working out variations, and tweaking the structure as i went along (which is why i have unused variables & unclean code)). 

i'm excited to see what may does this with this.

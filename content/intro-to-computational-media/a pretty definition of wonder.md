'wonder' had always been at the core of my artistic-practice. it is what drives me. in [[intro-to-computational-media/icm-class-1|icm-class-1]], i came across a pretty definition of *wonder*: 

>The 17th century philosopher Spinoza described "wonder" as a <mark>state of suspension</mark> in the mind, <mark>a paralysis</mark> resulting from a <mark>confrontation with something wholly new, disconnected from past experience</mark> such that judgements of whether it is good or bad are not possible. At this moment in time, we are caught in such a state of suspension with digital technologies. Creating computer applications, instead of simply using them will provide you with a deeper appreciation for the essential possibilities, limitations and unknowns of computation.

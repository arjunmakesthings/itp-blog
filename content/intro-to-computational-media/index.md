# why i took this class: 
i wanted to get fundamental clarity on how code works on a computing-machine, but mimi told me that this course is not about that. so, now, my reason for staying in the course is to explore the artistic potential of logic, and unlearn bad programming-habits / misunderstandings that i might have picked up along the way while i taught myself to code.

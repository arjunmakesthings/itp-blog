i, while working in previous jobs, referred to 'intuitive' (design) as a behaviour that needn't be taught to people. but, since, [[intro-to-physical-computing/nothing is intuitive, everything is learned]], is intuitive design simply a generalised assumption about people; meaning that [[all design (technically) excludes people]]. 

i'm still to read more academic definitions of this.

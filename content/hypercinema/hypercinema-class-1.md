# notes: 
- discussed [[thispersondoesnotexist]]. made me wonder about [[testing for racial-biases on thispersondoesnotexist]]
- saw [volvoxlabs](https://www.volvoxlabs.com/) & [culturehub](https://www.culturehub.org/). made me create the note: [[cool places or studios to look at]]. 
- did a deep-listening exercise. wondered about whether the audience ever 'deep-listens'. [[people/aidan nelson|aidan nelson]] told me that everyone takes *something* away, and <mark>our job is to make sure that that *something* is close to what we intended</mark>. 
- did a sound-recording exercise with a zoom-recorded. had done something like this before. realised that <mark>loud noises down out cool sound</mark>, especially in the u.s., and on the floor (with the a.c., the chaos, and what-not). made me want to ~~observe~~ <mark>absorb more</mark>.
- have to work with [[people/emilia|emilia]] on a soundscape-assignment.

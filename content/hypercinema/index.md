# why: 
primarily because it was mandated by the department. however, i am excited by: 

> Hypercinema will examine new forms of communication and storytelling through an investigation of time-based media ... Over the course of the semester, students will become comfortable with the basics of time-based media, and examine the contexts in which this media exists in society, both historically and in current practice.

> from the [syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q3FwfW1CQ-lesglrc4TPhsskkKoRgaAwVat77XK4CIU/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0). 

i'd like to re-explore my relationship with time-based media in this course, and examine it more critically.

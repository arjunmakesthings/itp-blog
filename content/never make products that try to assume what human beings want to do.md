[[people/shobhan|shobhan]] said this to me while i worked on [alerts](https://arjunmakesthings.github.io/projects/2025_vualerts/page.html) & [search-bar](https://arjunmakesthings.github.io/projects/2025_vusearchbar/page.html) for vunet, and it became more apparent while thinking about a [[perfect flushing mechanism]]. 

i was trying to suggest 'intelligent' features in both cases at vunet, and realised that machine-driven intelligence always opens up roads of frustration for people who use the machines, because sometimes it may *think* that people want to do *x*, but, in-fact, they may just want to do *y*. 

a product should always aid people in getting where they want efficiently, but never determine the singular path for them.

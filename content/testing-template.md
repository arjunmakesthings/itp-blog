# h1: 
this is what i use for everything.  here's a long paragraph, to check for comfortable leading: 

high school; study numbers; begin to realise that i'm decent at many things. spend summers in mountaineering schools; meet older people; observe <mark>mid-life</mark> crises; read thoreau; climb peaks; nearly die, survive. find friends; get into a relationship; watch sunsets with the dog. feel lonely. 

checking for tags; this thing, that is perhaps linked to note: [[index]], and tags: #typography and #something-else. 

---

i may have quotes, like so: 

> Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

# another heading: 
i may have lists, like so: 

1. this thing. 
2. this thing, that is perhaps linked to note: [[index]], and tags: #typography and #something-else. 

- item 1
- item 2

---

i will have a lot of code; like so: 

```
var a = 2; 
var b = 4; 

// a stupid comment.

function sum (a, b){
	var added = 0; 
		added = Math.add (a, b); 
	return added; 
}
```
``

---

and, i will have images. 

perhaps one; like so: 

![[z_images/ws-qr.jpg]]
<figcaption></figcaption>

or a bigger one, like so (with an empty figcaption for spacing): 

![[z_images/O1.webp]]
<figcaption></figcaption>

or, perhaps two images together (in a table): 

| ![[z_images/O2.webp]] | ![[z_images/O3.webp]] |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
<figcaption>something, something.</figcaption> 

or i can have a figcaption here, like so: 

![[z_images/O1.webp]]<figcaption>something, something.</figcaption>

# another heading:
finally, i may have footnotes [^1].

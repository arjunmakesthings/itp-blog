# notes:
- tom said that [[intro-to-physical-computing/all computing is physical|all computing is physical]], and that this course will help people understand how a computer works. 
- his research inclination (for this course) is to see how we can better (physical interaction with) an everyday object. 
- understood [[intro-to-physical-computing/how a breadboard works|how a breadboard works]]; some things about [[intro-to-physical-computing/electricity|electricity]] and [[intro-to-physical-computing/electrical components|electrical components]]. 
- discussed about [[intro-to-physical-computing/explicit vs implicit machine interaction|explicit vs implicit machine interaction]], that machines must have fast-feedback, and that [[intro-to-physical-computing/nothing is intuitive, everything is learned]]. 
- made me wonder about [[intro-to-physical-computing/is it is our duty to make people notice things?|is it is our duty to make people notice things?]],  [[intro-to-physical-computing/making things that invite people to play|making things that invite people to play]], and whether a [[perfect flushing mechanism]] could ever be produced. .

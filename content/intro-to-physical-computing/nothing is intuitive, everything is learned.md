[[people/tom igoe|tom igoe]] said that all interactions are learned. perhaps some things are more inviting (see: [[intro-to-physical-computing/making things that invite people to play]]) than others, and, perhaps, use similar patterns to what we've grown up using. 

but it then pushes me to question — [[what is intuitive design?]], since i've grown up using the word around a lot; partly referring to interactions that were easy to do or assumed to be learned.

> All computing is physical ... Computing, even when we call it “virtual”, “cloud”, or other names, always has physical consequences. This course is about how to design physical devices that we interact with using our bodies.

# why i took this class: 
i had used arduinos & basic electronics-principles to make a couple of projects during my undergraduate-degree, but was never able to explore the depths of it — i could only satisfy so much of my curiosity while balancing a full-time job, and most of it went elsewhere.

i wish to use this course to understand how electricity works, and how it may be used as a creative-medium; to design computational-things for people that live outside this rectangular screen.

everything is made of atoms. 

atoms contain electrons, that are loose in conductive materials (such as metal). in a closed circuit, electrons flow from positive to negative terminals to generate an 'electric-flow', or current. tom also said, in [[intro-to-physical-computing/ipc-class-1|ipc-class-1]], that electricity always moves from 'high' (voltage) to 'low' (ground (gnd)) areas.

# voltage:
pushing force of the electrons in a circuit. also expressed as: 

`volt - joules (heat) / colomb (group of electrons (6.25 Ã— 10^18 electrons.))`

---
# current: 
flow of electrons, measured in ampere. also: 

`1 amp = 1 coulomb`

---
# resistance: 
restricts the flow of electrons by causing collisions of electrons, and getting them to expend heat. 

everything (i assume this means all conductors) has *some* resistance. so, an electric circuit loses current as it passes through every component.

electricity can also produce magnetic-fields, with [[electromagnetism]].

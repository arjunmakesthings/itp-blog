i realise that people need space for physical-computing. i need to be able to move around, to stand above circuits, to be close to flexible sources of power. 

so, working on physical-computing in the night, perhaps, won't work for me; and i can do more computer-related stuff then, such as [[intro-to-computational-media/index|intro-to-computational-media]] work.

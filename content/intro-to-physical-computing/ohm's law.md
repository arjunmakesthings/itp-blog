ohm's law is defined as: 

`i = v / r`

where i = current, v = voltage, and r = resistance.

i found it cool that a battery sitting on a shelf is also a part of a circuit. however, since the resistance of air is very high. therefore, the current flowing through it is nothing.

but if we connect two ends of a battery, the resistance is (virtually) 0. so, there's too much c

examples came from a book called 'code'.

[[people/tom igoe|tom igoe]], in [[intro-to-physical-computing/ipc-class-1|ipc-class-1]], spoke about how it's our duty to make people notice things, and want to interact with it. he uses the kinetic-project at itp as an example to explain this:

this project is strategically placed in-front of the opening-doors of itp, almost forcing people to interact with it.

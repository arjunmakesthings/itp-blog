# testing multimeter: 
couldn't get multimeter to beep, as said here: https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/electronics/

tried two multimeters. but i know they're working, because [[people/matt | matt]] & i tested it on an active circuit. 

i asked [[people/tom igoe|tom igoe]], and he told me that i was using the wrong mode. the dials on the multimeter select different modes. for continuity, you want to put the dial on continuity.

# what's inside a jumper wire: 
broke a jump wire. became curious about what's inside a jumper wire.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_wire

it seems like it's made from some kind of metal inside, and an insular layer outside. there is a fragile pin, that is then used to connect to breadboards.

# checking for continuity on a breadboard: 
i wanted to see if i could check continuity on a breadboard.

however this didn't beep as it was supposed to. i can't figure out why, and will ask the p-comp help-desk today.

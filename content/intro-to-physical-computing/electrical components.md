a list of electrical components, and what they do; as learnt in [[intro to physical computing]]. 

# resistor: 
a resistor essentially takes electricity as input, and limits the output. the resistance (see [[intro-to-physical-computing/electricity]]) used must be appropriate for the output, and is usually understood by the type of band that is present on the resistor.

there are different types of resistors; some are variable (change resistance based on data such as light or force).

# microcontrollers: 
simple computers designed to take input and give output; essentially a fancy voltage-manipulator. arduino is a type of microcontroller, and [[people/tom igoe]] co-founded it.

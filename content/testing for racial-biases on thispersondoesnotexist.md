it would be interesting to pull data from [[thispersondoesnotexist]], and see the inclinations over population. 

i.e: if the algorithm spits out a white male more times than it spits out an indian female, and the population-count suggests otherwise, then the algorithm that generates these faces is racially-biased. and, then, to identify what racial-inclinations it has (because it will have *some* inclination).

# philosophy: 
i am a graduate-student on a mission [^1] — information is all around me, and i do not wish for it to merely blow by. itp academically mandates each student to maintain a blog, and i wanted to maintain mine in a non-arborescent fashion [^2]. 

for the last 3 years, i have carefully maintained a closed *[zettlekasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)* or 'digital-brain'. that project is now paused, as all my time goes into itp, and this blog becomes my central repository.

# system:
i <mark>collect</mark> notes (or images). these may arise from:
- conversations
- thoughts
- reading 
- lectures (i consider classes, podcasts, and any other (primarily) unidirectional audio-exchange as lectures). 
- observations
![[z_images/250901 • temporal-drawings(1).webp]]

these may then interconnect amongst themselves, and / or <mark>evolve</mark> into: 
- ideas
- experiments
- research
- writings (writings deemed complete may find their way to my [website](https://arjunmakesthings.github.io/notes.html) )

![[z_images/250901 • temporal-drawings(2).webp]]

at the end of this tryst between the abstract (collection; some evolution) and the concrete (artifacts during evolution, often via *making*), i may be <mark>left with</mark>: 
- projects (which may then find their way to my [website](https://arjunmakesthings.github.io/projects.html))
- reflections (which will also be considered *writings*)

these, i may choose to share with the outside world. 

![[z_images/250901 • temporal-drawings(3).webp]]
the above-mentioned list items are also searchable as tags (for example, search for #writings). i can't link them all on this page because of the way quartz is structured. 

i may, also, require folders — containing all entries made during / related to a specific course. these will show up on the left (or inside the kebab-menu on a phone).

# navigation:

> The garden is the web as topology. Every walk through the garden creates new paths, new meanings, and when we add things to the garden we add them in a way that allows many future, unpredicted relationships.

perhaps the best way is to wander, and tell me about the new paths that you discovered. 

however, in general, navigation on the desktop looks like so:

similar on the phone, but with these differences:

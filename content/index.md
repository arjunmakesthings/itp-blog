# philosophy: 
i am a graduate-student on a mission [^1] — information is all around me, and i do not wish for it to merely blow by. itp academically mandates each student to maintain a blog, and i wanted to maintain mine in a non-arborescent fashion [^2]. 

for the last 3 years, i have carefully maintained a closed *[zettlekasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)* or 'digital-brain'. that project is now paused, as all my time goes into itp, and this blog becomes my central repository.

# system:
i <mark>collect</mark> notes (or images). these may arise from:
- #conversations
- #thoughts
- #reading
- #lectures (i consider podcasts — or any other unidirectional audio-exchange as lectures too). 
- #observations 

![[z_images/250901 • temporal-drawings(1).webp]]

these may then interconnect amongst themselves, and / or <mark>evolve</mark> into: 
- #ideas
- #experiments
- #research
- #writings  (writings deemed complete may find their way to my [website](https://arjunmakesthings.github.io/notes.html) )

![[z_images/250901 • temporal-drawings(2).webp]]

at the end of this tryst between the abstract (collection; some evolution) and the concrete (artifacts during evolution, often via *making*), i may be <mark>left with</mark>: 
- #projects (which may then find their way to my [website](https://arjunmakesthings.github.io/projects.html))
- #reflections (which will also be considered #writings)

![[z_images/250901 • temporal-drawings(3).webp]]
these, i may choose to share with the outside world. 

i *may* also require folders with all the entries for specific courses, and they will show up on the left (or inside the kebab-menu on a phone).

# navigation:

perhaps the best way is to wander, and tell me about the new paths that you discovered. 

however, in general, navigation on the desktop looks like so:

similar on the phone, but with these differences:
